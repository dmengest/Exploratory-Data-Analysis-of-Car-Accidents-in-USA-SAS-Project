# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Car-Accidents-in-USA-SAS-Project

## Introduction

The project focused on analyzing and understanding traffic accidents in the state of Pennsylvania, with the goal of identifying factors that influence accidents and their severity. The dataset used for analysis was collected from February 2016 to June 2020 and obtained from the Kaggle website.

## Data Preparation and Manipulation

The analysis started with data preparation and manipulation. The dataset was explored, variables were renamed and formatted for convenience. The analysis was then narrowed down to the top 10 counties with the highest number of accidents. Descriptive statistics were calculated for various weather variables, including humidity, temperature, wind chill, pressure, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation.

The investigation of missing values in the weather variables revealed the number of missing values for each variable. Precipitation had the highest number of missing values, while pressure had the least. A bar chart was created to visualize the missing values for all weather variables.

## Data Analysis

The number of accidents per county was analyzed, and it was found that Montgomery had the highest number of accidents, followed by Lancaster and York. A bar graph was created to illustrate the frequency of accidents in the top 10 counties.

Factors affecting the severity of accidents were also examined. The association between time factors (years, months, days of the week, and hours) and severity of accidents was analyzed. The analysis revealed trends in the number of accidents over the years and across different time periods. For example, the number of accidents generally decreased from 2016 to 2020, except for a sharp increase in Montgomery in 2017.

The association between weather variables and severity of accidents was explored. While there was no strong correlation between weather variables and severity, some associations were observed. Clear weather conditions were associated with the most severe accidents, and pressure was negatively correlated with high severity. On the other hand, wind chill and wind speed were positively associated with high severity levels.

## Conclusion 
The analysis provided insights into the factors influencing traffic accidents and their severity in Pennsylvania. The findings can be used to understand the patterns of accidents, improve road safety measures, and develop strategies to reduce accidents and their impact.
